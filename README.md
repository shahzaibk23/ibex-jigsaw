# Ibex-Jigsaw
Test enviroment to connect jigsaw devices w/ Ibex core in CHISEL &amp; compile the design w/ CIRCT IR to analyze the dumped SV

This repo contains CHISEL Wrapper of [Ibex](https://github.com/lowrisc/ibex) connected with Block RAMs from [Jigaw](https://gihtub.com/merledu/jigsaw) by use of [Caravan](https://github.com/mereldu/caravan). The SV of this design is dumped with regular [FIRRTL](https://github.com/shahzaibk23/ibex-jigsaw/blob/main/IbexJigsaw.sv) and CIRCT [firtool](https://github.com/shahzaibk23/ibex-jigsaw/blob/main/IbexJigsawCirct.sv) to analyze the extent of clean RTL being generated by CIRCT.
